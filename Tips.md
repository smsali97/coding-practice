# Interview tips

- first rephrase the problem statement what you understand


- try to ask a couple of edge cases questions etc
- propose a possible solution <--> do a dry run of it
- once all is done only then jump to code
- best case is to rewrite existing pseudocode as code so you just spend time coding
